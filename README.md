# home-dashboard-app

This is going to be an that will help me and my family organize our lives. Will live on a screen at the exit of our house.

I will be using the BEM CSS styling method when it comes time to get the styles set. I don't think I will use a framework unless it is a very minimal one, such as Tailwind.

## List of components that will be a part of this app:

* To do list
* messages
* shopping list
* weather widget
* news widget
* train information?
