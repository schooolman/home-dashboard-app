# home-dashboard-app

This is going to be an that will help me and my family organize our lives. Will live on a screen at the exit of our house.

I will be using the BEM CSS styling method when it comes time to get the styles set. I don't think I will use a framework unless it is a very minimal one, such as Tailwind.

## List of components that will be a part of this app:

* To do list
* messages
* shopping list
* weather widget
* news widget
* train information?

## Work To Do

* Display Weather info in component
* hook up database to to do list
* create to do item component
* Set up Sass
* refactor CSS to Sass
* Look into text message to do list functionality
* To do list store tasks in firebase

## Integrating a messaging system into the app

* Started looking into different services like Twilio and Zapier and integrating those into cloudbase.
* I think that the way to go is going to be to hook up an email to zapier that forwards the contents to firebase.
* Twilio will cost money eventually.
* I set up a gmail account to handle the messages, homemessageapp@gmail.com and need to verify it with zapier parser application to handle the incomming messages.
